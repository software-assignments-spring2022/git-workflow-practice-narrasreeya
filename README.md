[Some Musings on how we write code](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/some-musings-on-how-we-write-code-bc0e4fb5cab2) by James Adams.

This article by James Adams is a reflection on how programmers actually tend to work and the need for meaningful interactions with fellow developers to facilitate a programmer's growth. As we know that the standards of quality differ for every team and even programmer. These standards are influenced by your environment, your coworkers and the technologies you adopt. You may have to deal with legacy code at a big company. At a smaller company, you have to get things faster and are less likely to write good tests. However, Adam suggests that **no programmer is an island** and to be a good programmer, you need to be surrounded by motivated programmers who can bring out the best in you. Adams says, *"Spend a year with a developer who is significantly smarter, more experienced than you, and who actually gives a fuck about you getting better,and you'll see what I mean."* I found this article interesting since I've coded projects only on an individual level up until now and this article allowed me to explore the importance of working in teams in order to become a better programmers. I also feel the theme of this article is highly relevant to the agile concepts that emphasises individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

This article is very interesting. As I have largely only worked on independent projects in Computer Science (for classes), I have not had the opportunity to experience the wide variety of ways there are to code the same piece of software. However, I now see how my coding styles have been largely influenced by my organization (Profs at NYU, in an academic setting).
